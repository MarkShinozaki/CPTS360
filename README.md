# Labs Completed 

### [`Pre Lab 1`](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS360-SystemsProgrammingInUnix-Linux/tree/Labs/Pre-Lab1)
- Prepare for Lab 1 by understanding the basics of stack frames, function calls, and memory addressing in C.

### [`Pre Lab 2`](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS360-SystemsProgrammingInUnix-Linux/tree/Labs/Pre-lab2/LAB2pre)
- Introduce the core concepts of process management within an operating system kernel simulation, focusing on how processes are managed, forked, and handled by the OS.

### [`Lab 2`](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS360-SystemsProgrammingInUnix-Linux/tree/Labs/Lab%202)
- Build a complex shell simulator (`mysh`) that handles Unix-like commands, process management, I/O redirection, and piping.

### [`Lab 3`](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS360-SystemsProgrammingInUnix-Linux/tree/Labs/Lab%203)
- Solve a system of linear equations using Gauss elimination with partial pivoting in a multi-threaded context.

### [`Lab 4`](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS360-SystemsProgrammingInUnix-Linux/tree/Labs/Lab%204)

- Implement a multi-threaded TCP-based client-server application capable of executing commands on both the server and client sides.

### [`Lab 5`](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS360-SystemsProgrammingInUnix-Linux/tree/Labs/Lab%205)

- Work with a virtual disk image containing an EXT2 file system and develop a program to display the disk blocks of a specified file.
