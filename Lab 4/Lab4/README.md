# Run the program
1) open two terminals
2) navigate one terminal to the server folder and the other to the client folder
3) start the server first
4) start the client

If you get some sort of bind or connection error, wait a little bit before trying to open the server and client again. Sometimes the server is a little bit finicky so you might have to do some trouble shooting on your own. Make sure you start the server before the client, otherwise they will not connect to each other.

The client.bin and server.bin are the examples provided by Professor Wang. Try running multiple clients on the single server by opening up more client terminals. "YOUR server MUST be MULTI-threaded by processes" means you can connect multiple clients to the server. It is up to you to implement this feature.
